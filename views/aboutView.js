        <p>
          Vinobo is a web app that allows users to take personal notes during YouTube videos, as
          well as to search for content in a video using the video{"'"}s transcript. Our app is
          intended to help students taking online-based courses, and Vinobo lets you save all your
          notes and videos until the next time you study. Please sign up by clicking the banner, and
          explore the possibilities of Vinobo!

        <h2>How to use</h2>
        <p>
          Start by copying the YouTube link of a video that you would like to take notes for. Then,
          paste it in the left sidebar on the main page and click Add. The video and it{"'"}s
          transcripts will now load. You can now watch the video, search in the transcript, and take
          notes. Add a note by typing in the form below the video. The timestamp can be manually set
          or left empty (empty timestamp uses current video time).
